a:T4f2,The spiking federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed learning paradigm that allows resource-constrained devices to train collaboratively at low power consumption without exchanging local data. It takes advantage of both the privacy computation property in FL and the energy efficiency in spiking neural networks (SNNs). However, existing spiking FL methods employ a random selection approach for client aggregation, assuming unbiased client participation. This neglect of statistical heterogeneity significantly affects the convergence and precision of the global model. In this work, we propose a credit assignment-based active client selection strategy for spiking federated learning, the SFedCA, to aggregate clients contributing to the global sample distribution balance judiciously. Specifically, the client credits are assigned by the firing intensity state before and after local model training, which reflects the difference in local data distribution from the global model. The comprehensive experiments are conducted on various non-identical and independent distribution (non-IID) scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that the SFedCA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art spiking FL methods and requires fewer communication rounds.b:T6cf,@ARTICLE{zhan2025sfedca,

}c:T549,In recent years, deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated promising performance across various applications, owing to their low-power characteristics. Research on SNN meta-learning has enabled SNNs to reduce both label cost and computational power consumption in few-shot classification tasks. However, current SNN meta-learning methods still lag behind traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) in terms of accuracy. In this work, we explore a two-stage metric-based SNN meta-learning framework that achieves the highest accuracy performance in SNN. This framework comprises a pre-training stage and a meta-training stage. During pre-training, a classification embedding SNN model (CESM) is trained to extract image features. Subsequently, in the meta-training stage, the meta embedding SNN model (MESM) employs the centered kernel alignment (CKA) method to measure the similarity between these learned features for meta-learning. We conduct extensive experiments on the Omniglot, tieredImageNet, and miniImageNet datasets, evaluating both CESM and MESM models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework improves performance by 5% on average compared to previous SNN meta-learning approaches. The proposed method surpasses the early classical ANN methods and further closes the gap with ANN state-of-the-art methods.d:T732,@article{ZHAN2024111220,

}e:T654,Recent advances in bio-inspired vision with event cameras and associated spiking neural networks (SNNs) have provided promising solutions for low-power consumption neuromorphic tasks. However, as the research of event cameras is still in its infancy, the amount of labeled event stream data is much less than that of the RGB database. The traditional method of converting static images into event streams by simulation to increase the sample size cannot simulate the characteristics of event cameras such as high temporal resolution. To take advantage of both the rich knowledge in labeled RGB images and the features of the event camera, we propose a transfer learning method from the RGB to the event domain in this paper. Specifically, we first introduce a transfer learning framework named R2ETL (RGB to Event Transfer Learning), including a novel encoding alignment module and a feature alignment module. Then, we introduce the temporal centered kernel alignment (TCKA) loss function to improve the efficiency of transfer learning. It aligns the distribution of temporal neuron states by adding a temporal learning constraint. Finally, we theoretically analyze the amount of data required by the deep neuromorphic model to prove the necessity of our method. Numerous experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art SNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on event streams, including N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech101. This indicates that the R2ETL framework is able to leverage the knowledge of labeled RGB images to help the training of SNN on event streams.f:T7f4,@ARTICLE{zhan2024spiking,

}10:T453,Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained a lot of attention and achievements recently because of their low-power advantages on neuromorphic hardware. However, training deep SNNs still requires a large number of labeled data which are expensive to obtain. To address this issue, we propose an effective Bio-inspired Active Learning (BAL) method in this paper to reduce the training cost of SNN models. Specifically, bio-inspired behavior patterns of spiking neurons are defined to represent the internal states of SNN models for active learning. Then, an active learning sample selection strategy is proposed by leveraging the empirical and generalization pattern divergence in SNNs. By labeling selected samples and adding them to training, behavioral patterns can be optimized to improve the performance of neural networks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets with various sample proportions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BAL achieves state-of-the-arts performance in SNNs compared with the existing active learning methods.11:T620,@article{ZHAN2023110193,

However, training deep SNNs requires many labeled data that are expensive to obtain in real-world applications, as traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). In order to address this issue, transfer learning has been proposed and widely used in traditional ANNs, but it has limited use in SNNs. In this article, we propose an effective transfer learning framework for deep SNNs based on the domain in-variance representation. Specifically, we analyze the rationality of centered kernel alignment (CKA) as a domain distance measurement relative to maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in deep SNNs. In addition, we study the feature transferability across different layers by testing on the Office-31, Office-Caltech-10, and PACS datasets.
